In the fast-paced environment as IT, I would bet on someone who loves what he does and learns constantly. And I am just such a person. I became a good professional in what I do not because I passed the exams, but because I like it. It has begun as a hobby and now I am an excellent project manager and an outstanding SEO expert. Therefore, my websites get on the first page of the Google."
